		    <p> Modeling a science topic in CTSiM
			<br/> A good way to think of how to build a model for a science topic starts with identifying the entities that are part of the science topic and actively do something in the topic. For example, if we are building a model for the traffic outside your school, cars, school-buses and pedestrians would be examples of such entities.
			These entities are called agents. Once we have identified the agents in the model, we need to describe properties of the agents that are of interest to us, and what the agents do. We refer to each feature describing an agent as an agent property agent property, and each thing that an agent does as part of an agent's behavior. In other words, an agent may have more than one behavior. For example, if we consider the school-bus agent, we could describe it using properties like speed, number of seats, and color. The bus would have different behaviors like 'Move at a constant speed', 'Slow down', and 'Speed up'.
			After specifying the properties and behaviors for each agent, we need to describe what happens in each agent behavior. An agent behavior describes how the agent interacts with other agents and also with its surrounding environment. The entities in the environment are called environment elements and features describing them are known as environment element properties. An agent's behavior can act on and change its own properties or properties of other agents or environment element properties. The behavior might also depend on different agent and environment element properties and will have to sense those properties.
			For example, in the bus agent's 'Slow down' behavior, the speed of the bus decreases and we say that the 'speed' property of the bus is acted upon. But, when does the speed of the bus decrease? It could decrease when the bus is approaching a red light or stop sign, or when the road is icy, or when there is a car moving slowly in front of it. Thus, the 'Slow down' behavior for the bus agent will have to sense environment properties like traffic-light color and road condition and agent properties like car speed.
			The chart below shows what we have discussed above.
			Read the pages on agents, environment elements, properties, and behaviors for specific examples and more information on how to describe a science topic in CTSiM.
			<br/> Agents <br/> 
			<br/> When modeling a science topic, we need to first identify the entities that actively do something in the topic. These entities are called agents.
			For example, suppose we want to describe the traffic on the road in front of your school. Here, the cars on the road are agents because they actively move at different speeds and in different directions. If there are school-buses, bicycles and pedestrians on the road, they are other types of agents that participate in our traffic model. So we see that a model can have one agent or multiple agents.
			Agent type 1: car; Agent type 2: school-bus; Agent type 3: bicycle; Agent type 4: pedestrian
			Once we have identified the agents in the model, we need to describe features of the agents and what the agents do. We refer to each feature describing the agent as an agent property, and each thing that the agent does as an agent behavior. Agents interact with other agents, as well as other things around them that are not agents. These surrounding entities are called environment elements.<br/>	
 			<br/> Environment elements <br/>
			<br/> Unlike agents, there are entities in a topic that do not actively do anything. We call them environment elements.
			For example, suppose we want to describe the traffic on the road in front of your school. Here, the road is an example of an environment element. A model can have more than one type of environment element. In our traffic model, traffic lights can be considered as another type of environment element.
			Environment element type 1: road; Environment element type 2: traffic light
			Once we have identified the types of environment elements in a topic, we need to specify features to describe each of the types. We refer to each feature describing an environment element as an environment element property.	
			<br/> Properties - Agent properties and Environment element properties <br/>
			<br/> When describing a science topic, we need to specify properties for all the entities in the topic. These properties help describe an entity and distinguish it from other entities.
			In any topic, there are broadly two kinds of entities - agents which actively do something, and environment elements which surround the agents and do not actively do anything. Both agents and environment elements have properties. For example, if we are describing the traffic on the road, cars are a type of agent, and the roads and traffic lights are types of environment elements. Cars' properties include color, size, and speed. Examples of the road's properties are number of lanes, speed limit, and condition (icy or dry), and an example of a traffic light's property is color (for example, red, yellow, and green).
			Most properties have values. For example, if a red car is running at 45 mph, we say that its "color" property has the value "red", and its "speed" property has the value "45". Similarly, if a road is icy, we say its "condition" property has the value "icy".
			Once we have set the value of a property, we can refer to the property using just its property name, rather than its value. For example, we can set the speed of our car by saying "set speed = 50". Now we can just say "forward (speed)" which will make the car move forward by 50 units. When we run our program, the computer will automatically look at the value of the property "speed" and move forward at that speed.	
			<br/> Agent behaviors <br/>
			<br/> Agents are entities that actively do something. We call each thing that an agent does a behavior. When we are specifying an agent's behaviors, we separate different things that the agent does into different behaviors. Continuing our previous example with the traffic scenario, let us think of examples of a car's behaviors in a traffic model. A car stops when it sees a stop sign or when the traffic light is red. When the traffic light is green, the car moves forward. A car will slow down if the road is icy or if there is a slow-moving vehicle in front of the car. In each of these scenarios, do you recognize the car's behaviors? The car's behaviors include stopping, moving forward, and slowing down.
			Once you specify an agent's behaviors, you need to think about each behavior in terms of the properties it needs to sense and the properties it needs to act on. Read the next page for example on how to do this.	
			<br/> Modeling agent behaviors using sensed and acted on properties <br/>
			<br/> Once you specify an agent's behaviors, you need to think about what are the things a behavior needs to know and what are the things it changes. A behavior changes or acts on certain properties and senses certain other properties in order to make these changes. An agent behavior can both sense and act on own properties, as well as other agent properties or environment properties.
			For example, think about a car's "Stop at red light" behavior. When the car senses that the traffic light color is red, it slows down and finally stops by changing or acting on its speed. The figure below shows how to represent the car's behavior in terms of its sensed and acted on properties. <br/>
			<br/> Example of Conceptual Modeling for Different Topics<br/>
			<br/> Let's think of another example from real life and try to model it conceptually using the agent framework we read about in the previous pages. Consider a scenario that involves a human and the vacuum-cleaning robot, Roomba, in a room. Roomba moves around the room to clean floors and carpets. Roomba is also able to change direction when it encounters human and walls in the room. When Roomba's charge runs out, it goes to a charging station positioned on a wall to recharge itself. Although Roomba can clean, move and recharge by itself, humans are responsible for turning Roomba on and off.
			To model this scenario, we can consider humans and Roomba as two types of agents with different sets of behaviors, and we can consider the floor, the walls and Roomba's charging station as environment elements. First, we need to think about the properties of each agent and environment element in this scenario. Examples of human agents' properties are location and energy, while examples of the Roomba agent's properties are location, direction, charge, and its On/Off switch. Examples of the floor's property could be its clealiness, the wall's property its location, and Roomba's charging station's property its position.
			Next, we need to think about the agent behaviors. Human behaviors are switching Roomba on and off, and moving around the house. Roomba's behaviors are cleaning and recharging. We can represent this conceptual model as shown below.<br/>
			<br/> Programming an agent model<br/>
			<br/> While writing a program to model a science topic, we need to follow two steps. First, we write a procedure or sub-program to describe each agent behavior. While writing the procedures, we will need to express how the agent interacts with other agents and the environment in that procedure. To express these, we will need to learn about some computer-science commands like "Repeat" and "When...Do...Otherwise do...". Then, we need to specify each of the procedures using a "Go" procedure. The "Go" procedure is where our program starts running and only the procedures specified there will be included while generating simulations for our program.
			Let us consider the scenario on the previous page with Humans and Roomba, the vacuum-cleaning robot in a room. Roomba cleans the room and recharges its own battery. Humans do not have to clean the room but they move around and switch Roomba on and off as needed. So, if we want to write a program for this scenario, we will need to write 2 procedures for Human agents: one called "Switch Roomba On and Off" and another called "Move around the room." Similarly, we also need to write 2 procedures for the Roomba agent: one called "Clean" and another called "Recharge."
			We also need to write a main "Go" procedure for each agent that calls the different procedures for that agent. In our example, both Human and Roomba agents will have a main "Go" procedure that calls their respective procedures, as shown in the figure below.
			For example, for describing the "Switch Roomba On and Off" procedure for Human agents, the behavior will check if the floor is clean or dirty. If the floor is dirty, Human agents will switch Roomba's On/Off property to On. Otherwise, they will switch it Off. We can represent this using the "When...Do...Otherwise do..." block.
			Similarly, the "Recharge" behavior for Roomba will use the "When...Do...Otherwise Do..." block to sense if its battery charge is low. When the battery charge is low, Roomba can use the "Repeat" block to specify the following action multiple times: "Battery charge is low, so move backwards" till it reaches its charging station.
			So far, we have described agent procedures. But how do you write a program for each agent procedure? Well, you need to drag and drop different blocks which will be provided to you and arrange them in a way that makes sense for the procedure. The blocks can be of different types like Agents, Agent Properties, Actions, Chemicals, Sensing Conditions, Sensing Amounts, and Controls. Each type of block is generally color coded differently. For example, all Sensing Condition blocks may be purple, while all Action blocks may be blue. So, what do each of these types of blocks express?
			When you're dragging and dropping blocks, you need to remember that all blocks cannot be randomly dropped into other blocks. For example, you cannot put an Action block into the "When" block of a "When...Do...Otherwise do..." block, and you cannot put a Sensing Condition block into the "Do" part of a "When...Do...Otherwise Do..." block. Also, you can only drop on block into another block if both of those blocks are of the same color. For example, in the figure below, the blocks in the left pane were provided and they have been dragged to the right pane and arranged to describe a Swim procedure for Human agents. Notice how you can only drop a pink Sensing Condition block into the pink "When" block, and you can only drop a yellow Properties block into the yellow block within the Sensing Condition block.<br/>
			<br/> Representing sense-act processes using "When... Do... Otherwise do..."<br/>
			<br/> We use the "When... Do... Otherwise do..." block to measure a property, and act in one way or another based on the measurement. Basically, when we represent a "sense-act" process, we "sense" whether a property satisfies a certain condition, and decide to "act" in some way based on what we sense.
			Imagine you are told to play video games indoors if it is raining outside. We can express this using the "When... Do... Otherwise do..." block like this:
			As we can see from this example, we first check whether a condition is satisfied. In this case, we sense whether it is raining. When the condition is satisfied, we act in some way. In this case, the decision is to "play video games indoors."
			Notice that we can leave "Otherwise do..." blank if we don't want to do anything when the condition is not satisfied. However, we cannot leave "Do" blank.
			A lot of times, we want to do something when a condition is satisfied, but do something else when the condition is not satisfied. For example, we may decide to stay indoors when it is raining. Otherwise (when it's not raining), we may decide to go play football.
			Now we can express this using "When... Do... Otherwise do..." like this:
			We can also put this in another way and say "When it is not raining, play football. Otherwise, play video games indoors."
			Similarly, think of the scenario described on the previous page where Roomba cleans the floor when Human agents switch Roomba On. We describe the "Clean" procedure for Roomba using the "When...Do...Otherwise do..." blocks as shown below.
			Sometimes, you may need multiple "When...Do...Otherwise do" blocks to represent more complex sense-act processes.<br/>
			<br/> Representing multiple actions under one condition<br/>
			<br/> Sometimes, when one condition is true, we act in multiple ways. For example, when it is hot outside, we may decide to go swim at the beach and eat ice cream. One way to represent these actions is how we did in the previous page.
			But we can also represent two actions under one condition using only one "When...Do...Otherwise Do..." block instead of two. To do this, we simply drag and drop multiple actions in to the "Do" block and it will look like the block below. This block tells us that when the condition, "It is hot outside," is satisfied, we go swim at the beach and we also eat ice cream.
			We can also decide to do something else when the condition is not satisfied. For example, if it is not hot outside, we may decide to swim indoors instead. See the block below. It says that when it is hot outside, we go swim at the beach and eat ice cream; but if it is not hot outside, we swim indoors.<br/>
			<br/> Representing actions which happen when multiple conditions are true<br/>
			<br/> So far, we have seen that when one condition is true, we act in one way or in multiple ways; and when that condition is not true, we act in completely different ways. Now, what if multiple conditions need to be true before we can act? For example, let's say, if you wanted to go swim at the beach, these conditions need to be satisfied: (1) It is daylight and (2) It is not raining.
			You could try representing the scenario using two sets of "When...Do...Otherwise Do..." blocks as shown below. Do you think the two sets of blocks below correctly represent the scenario in which multiple conditions need to be satisfied before an action can happen?
			Actually the two "When...Do...Otherwise Do..." blocks above are incorrect. Why? Well, if it is daylight outside but it is raining, you cannot go swim at the beach. Similarly, if it is not daylight outside, you cannot go swim at the beach, whether or not it is raining. Thus, both of the conditions above need to be true at the same time. In other words, when it is daylight, we need to make sure it is not raining outside, and if it is not raining outside, then we can go swim at the beach. So how can we represent these multiple conditions in "When...Do...Otherwise Do..." blocks correctly? Look at the nested blocks below.
			What we have done here is dragged one "When...Do...Otherwise Do..." block into the "Do" segment of another "When...Do...Otherwise Do..." block. We will need to do this every time we need to represent actions, which take place when multiple conditions are true at the same time.<br/>
			<br/> Representing complex "Sense-Act" processes<br/>
			<br/> In the previous example, we said "When it is raining outside, play video games indoors. Otherwise, play football." So we play football whenever it is not raining, that is to say, when it is cloudy or sunny.
			But what if we want to play football only when it is cloudy? What if we want to go to the beach when it is sunny? There are many situations like this, where we want to sense more than 1 condition. Is there a way to express these complex "sense-acts" with the "When... Do... Otherwise do..." block? Yes, like this:
			In this "When... Do... Otherwise do..." block, we first check whether it is raining outside. When it is raining outside, we play video games indoors. When it is not raining outside, we check whether it is sunny. When it is sunny, we go to the beach. Otherwise, when it is neither raining nor sunny outside, we go play football.<br/>
			<br/> The "Repeat" command<br/>
			<br/> We use the "Repeat" block to perform an action multiple times repeatedly.
			For example, your fitness coach may tell you to run around the baseball field 3 times. Here's how we would express this:
			As we can see from this example, first we put in the number of times that we want to repeat the action, and then we put in the action that we want to repeat.
			We can also repeat multiple actions in a "Repeat" block. For example, if you had to run around the baseball field and then take a water break before running another round and had to do this exercise 3 times, you could express it as follows:
			Can you predict what would happen if we used the "Repeat" command in this way instead:<br/>
